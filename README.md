# Health xAI Implementation Framework
This repository contains all the full-resolution files related to the supplementary materials of the Health xAI Implementation Framework.

## Background
This framework can guide AI developers to design machine learning pipelines for large-scale deployment for healthcare needs.
The framework helps AI developers to automate the selection of best modesl for healthcare challenges ranking them by their explainability as well as other clinical parameters important for patient outcomes. This is achieved by using reinforcement learning methods such as bandit learning to rank competing AI/ML models.

Developing AI/ML pipelines guided by this framework can ensure that critical aspects of digital health innovation have been considered. This includes features like transparency by using explainable methods, accountability by maintaining audit trails, and governance by implementing standardised design steps.

AI/ML models mostly predict one outcome and therefore, multiple models may be necessary for clinical decision-making.

In a fast-paced development scenario with multiple development sites and multiple teams, selecting the right model for the right clinical need can become challenging.


To solve complex healthcare challenges such as with Multiple Long-Term Conditions, the design, development, and deployment of models need to be scalable. Managing, modifying, and maintaining these models in large health systems is crucial to the proper implementation of AI-enhanced tools.

The framework can, therefore, not only be used by developers, but also domain experts, policy-makers, and funders to implement ethical AI/ML solutions for adopting in broader healthcare systems.
